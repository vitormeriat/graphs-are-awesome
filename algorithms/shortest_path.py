"""
Shortest Path
---
Write a function, shortest_path, that takes in a list of edges for an undirected graph and two nodes (node_A, node_B). 
The function should return the length of the shortest path between A and B. 
Consider the length as the number of edges in the path, not the number of nodes. 
If there is no path between A and B, then return -1.

# breadth first

e = number edges
