"""
Minimum Island
--
Write a function, minimum_island, that takes in a grid containing Ws and Ls. W represents water and L represents land. 
The function should return the size of the smallest island. 
An island is a vertically or horizontally connected region of land.

You may assume that the grid contains at least one island.

- r = number of rows
- c = number of columns
- Time: O(rc)
- Space: O(rc)
